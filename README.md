# NonGoFishGame
Finally another side project. This is gonna be a multiplayer version of "Fish". Not "Go Fish", "Fish".

The RUUUUUUUUUUUUUULES are simple.

## Prerequisites

1. There are (under standard rules) 9 half-suits of 6 cards each. The 2-7 of each suit, the 9-A of each suit, and all 4 8s plus both Jokers are one half-suit together.

2. There are two teams of 3 players each. No more, no less. They should be alternating around the circle in a physical game, but it really doesn't matter.

## Gameplay

1. Each player is dealt 9 cards each.

2. The goal is to "claim" the most half-suits for your team.

### Turns

1. On someone's turn, they choose a specific card.
a. They must have another part of the half-suit containing the card to choose it.

2. They choose someone on the opposing team to ask for this card.

3. If that person has the card, they must hand it over, and return to step 1.

4. If they don't, it becomes their turn.

### Claiming

At any time, any player can "claim". To do so, they must believe that every card in a certain half suit is owned by one of their teammates.

They must then list out the cards in the half-suit they believe to be owned by each of their teammmates.

If they are right, their team wins the half-suit.

If they are wrong, the other team wins the half-suit.

The game ends when all half-suits are claimed.
